In this piece, the artist combines natural and artificial light through computer-controlled sensors activated minutes before sunrise and sunset to create a captivating optical effect that evokes our most profound contemplation of light. What unfolds next is the illusion that the architecture of the space slowly vanishes as it becomes saturated with light and color, making it appear infinitely deep and closer to us—an effect Turrell refers to as “bringing the sky down.” In this treat for the senses, the artist seizes a universal concept—perception—and presents it’s most individualistic, personal nature. With heads tilted up and eyes fixed on the sky above, visitors can simply sit, relax, and experience the extraordinary.<\/p>", "blank": "node"}}, null, null, null, {"type": "zoomer", "url": "http://www.walkerart.org/collections/artworks/garden-seating-reading-thinking", "title": "Garden Seating, Reading, Thinking", "artist": "Kinji Akagawa", "year": "1987", "thumbnail": "http://cdn1.walkerart.org/public/collections-thumbs/wac_1015/740x531.jpeg", "fullsize_image": "http://collections-images.s3.amazonaws.com/refined/wac_1015.jpeg", "width": 2560, "height": 1837, "text": {"title": "Kinji Akagawa", "author_string": "Minneapolis Sculpture Garden", "citation": "Jenkins, Janet, ed. <em>Minneapolis Sculpture Garden<\/em>.

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, by contrast, when figurative sculpture was hardly the norm, Flanagan began making representational images (hares, helmets, and horses) using surprisingly traditional materials and processes: lost-wax bronze casting, gilding, stone carving. Here, an exuberant, bounding hare balances atop a classically formed bell, providing an interesting study in contrasts. The sinuous lines and playful vitality of the hare counter-balance the elegant formality of the bell, which evokes centuries of the bronze-casting tradition.
